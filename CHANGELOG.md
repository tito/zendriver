### Fixed

- `Browser.set_all` cookies function now correctly uses provided cookies @ilkecan

- Fix crash on starting browser in headless mode @ilkecan
- Fix `Browser.stop()` method to give the browser instance time to shut down before force killing @stephanlensky
- Many `ruff` lint issues @stephanlensky

### Added

- Support for linting with `ruff` and `mypy`. All `ruff` lints are fixed in the initial release, but many `mypy` issues remain to be fixed at a later date. @stephanlensky
- `py.typed` marker so importing as a library in other packages no longer causes `mypy` errors. @stephanlensky

### Changed

- Project is now built with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Automatically install dependencies to a venv with `uv sync`, run commands from the venv with `uv run`, and build the project with `uv build`. See the official [`uv` docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for more information. @stephanlensky
- Docs migrated from sphinx to [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). @stephanlensky
- `Browser.stop()` is now async (so it must be `await`ed) @stephanlensky

### Removed

- Twitter account creation example @stephanlensky
